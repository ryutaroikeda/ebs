ideas for features
------------------

* autocomplete task names

* set task to 'rest' if the current task is ticked.

* rm <task> - remove the task

* list should list incomplete tasks. Have option to print completed tasks.

* machine friendly output for predictions

* automatic recovery from backup

* more informative error messages

* make predictions more precise (down to minutes instead of days).

* configurable calendar
